Escape Plan: This game is played by both players at the same time. Each player has their own keys that control their movement. These are:

Player 1: ‘e’ to move up, ‘d’ to move down
Player 2: ‘i’ to move up, ‘j’ to move down

Using these keys, the players move through the screen. The goal of the game is to avoid the campus buildings and the upper and lower bounds. Whichever player violates this rule first loses the game and the remaining player wins, collecting the stars.
